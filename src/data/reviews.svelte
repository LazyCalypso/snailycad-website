            SnailyCAD is a fantastic CAD and I'm glad that I came across it. The installation is quite smooth. The dashboard is clean, straight to the point, and fast. The dispatcher panel that SnailyCAD has, gives dispatchers a lot more flexibility and control too. Citizen/User setup is a breeze! From the admin side, the level of customization is very high as well. You have complete control over the CAD and how it works for your community. The FiveM scripts that integrate with the CAD, work really well.

            In regards to support. It's excellent. Casper was happy to listen to my suggestions, and if you ever run into a snag, he will gladly help you out.

          <p>
            I recommend SnailyCAD to anyone who wants a great looking and easy to use CAD. The best part is that it is open source, free, actively supported, and superior to other options.

            Thank you Casper, and to all the contributors for working on SnailyCAD over all these years! I'll keep following the project!

              This is the only CAD you'll ever need. It's clean design and ease of use makes it incredibly accessible for your whole community. Couldn't be happier with the level of support and the speed at which bugs, feature releases and general updates are pushed.

              Casper engages with all the contributions (bug reports/feature requests) extremely quickly and always asks the right questions. The turnaround for some of the things I've submitted has been nothing short of incredible.

<p>What I have wanted to say for a long time, I am so glad I found this CAD/MDT system, it is the best free system I have found so far.
I have previously also tested SonoranCAD, which is also very good if it were cheaper.</p>

      The CAD is extremely customizable, fast and responsive. It uses no third party services for it
      to function properly, meaning that everything it does depends on your server's connection -
      not some other service.
    </p>
    <br className="block w-full my-1" />
    <p>
      The developer is very fast at responding to any issues, and promptly fixes and helps guide
      user's through any issues they may experience
    </p>
    <br className="block w-full my-1" />
    <p>
      It is completely open source, and has extremely thorough documentation for the api, meaning
      that you're able to integrate it with your server very easily.

            I started using SnailyCAD a few months ago after searching for a few months for a different cad that wasn't used on Bubble. I downloaded the cad and joined the discord to find that this was a very easy install and the developer behind it cares about the project.

This shows real dedication and I feel this is a really nice cad for being open source and free. I would recommend it to anyone looking for one.

<p>Here is my in-depth review after launching SnailyCAD as a beta in my server. Firstly, Casper is amazing, he does his best to help you out with support, he is very experienced and he knows what he is doing. </p>
<br className="block w-full my-1" />
<p>"What is the performance like":</p>
<br className="block w-full my-1" />

<p>From my experience using it with about 50 users after about a week. It runs great, im on a light VPS with okish specs. I use the manager on a windows vps so this might be different for others, but its very light on my vps and runs very smoothly.</p>
<br className="block w-full my-1" />

<p>"Is it easy to install":</p>
<br className="block w-full my-1" />

<p>Yes and No. If you have absolutely zero experience with homehosting and things like that, its probably going to be a pain in your butt. When I first heard of SnailyCAD, it was very complicated for me to install by myself, but once I realized that Casper can help out, he made the process very smoothly. From my experience, I suggest using the manager app if your on windows, it makes your life 100000 times easier.</p>
<br className="block w-full my-1" />

<p>Overall. The CAD/MDT is great. It runs great, very light weight on your system, it looks very professional and modern. The dispatch and everything about it is very realistic, I have worked with my local police department and have gotten some experience in their call center and had pretty much free range of a REAL MDT/CAD. Let me tell you, its legit, the live map, the blips, everything about it is realistic, the front end may not look like a real CAD/MDT, but the backend and how it functions is pretty close to it. I want to give a huge shoutout to Casper with the amount of work he has put into this.</p>`,
